(* Dimension analysis :

   Annotate iteration constructs with what variables are iterated over
    - Check that iteration is non-empty
    - Check that the dimension of binding variables are not ambiguous,
      i.e., guided by at least one bound iteration variable
    - Check that the dimension of binding variables is coherent *)
